# SemEval Task 2 

## The Right Name Will Present Itself

### Venv Setup 

Project was created in python version `3.11.10` 

You can use `pyenv` to set an explicit version to use if you are on another version (will require downloading pyenv)

Create a virtual environment with `python -m venv abc` (this creates a venv in the current directory and names the venv folder `abc`)

Activate the venv by typing `source ./abc/bin/activate` on mac (honestly not sure how it works on windows)

Install required packages via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
